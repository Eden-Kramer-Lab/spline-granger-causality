# spline-granger-causality
A procedure to reduce the parameters estimate in Granger-causal analysis through temporal smoothing.

Code to infer networks using a modified version of conditional Granger causality as described in <i> A procedure to increase power of Granger-causal analysis through temporal smoothing</i>.

Must have MVGC Multivariate Granger Causality toolbox to run as implemented in:

<i> Barnett, L., Seth, A.K., 2014. The MVGC multivariate Granger causality toolbox: A new approach to Granger-causal inference. J. Neurosci. Methods 223, 50â€“68. doi:10.1016/j.jneumeth.2013.10.018. </i>.

Three example simulations are provided:

1) main_sim_1N_high_freq.m
2) main_sim_1N_low_freq.m
3) main_sim_9N.m

Examples 1 and 2 fit models for one signal dominated by high or low frequencies, respectively.  Example 3 fits networks to a multivariate system of nine signals.
